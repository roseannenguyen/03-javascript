The assignment for Week 03 focused on using javascript to create an application to randomly generator passwords.

The objective of the assignment was to prompt user to select their preferred password criterias (including special characters, numbers, upper case, and lower case.) At the end, the password should be generated and display an alert or be written to the page.
